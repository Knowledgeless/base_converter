# base_converter
# I am new in python3. I tried to make a base converter with raw coding.
# Python3 has built in function to do this itself. But it has some problem while I tried to make change with a random base.
# This converter will be applicabe only to convert a Decimal number into other base. 
# Thanks and wish me good luck :-P
